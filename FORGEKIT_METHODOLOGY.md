# ForgeKit Methodology

A documentation-driven approach to building software projects with AI assistance. This document serves as a prompt/template to bootstrap new projects with a structured, phase-based development methodology.

---

## 🎯 Philosophy

**ForgeKit** is about maintaining momentum while building complex software with AI assistance. The key principles:

1. **Documentation as Code** - Plans are living documents with checkboxes that track progress
2. **Phase-Based Development** - Break overwhelming projects into digestible phases
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Each phase folder contains increasing detail levels
4. **AI-Friendly Structure** - Clear hierarchy helps AI assistants maintain context
5. **Iterative Planning** - Plans evolve as you learn more about the domain

---

## 📁 Monorepo Project Structure

This approach uses a **monorepo structure** with separate packages for client and server, unified by shared documentation and tooling at the root level.

```

├── README.md                    # Quick start, setup, overview
├── package.json                 # Root package.json (workspace config)

### Why Monorepo?

- **Shared tooling** - Single ESLint, TypeScript, and Prettier config
- **Atomic commits** - Frontend and backend changes in one commit
- **Simplified dependencies** - Shared types, protocols, and utilities
- **Unified documentation** - One `docs/` folder covers the whole system
- **Easier refactoring** - Cross-package changes are easier to coordinate

### Package Boundaries

| Package            | Responsibility                         | Dependencies                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `apps/web/`        | UI, user interactions, state           | API client, shared types    |
| `apps/api/`        | Business logic, data persistence, auth | Database, external services |
| `packages/shared/` | Shared utilities, types, constants     | None                        |
| `docs/`            | Documentation only                     | N/A                         |

### Feature-Based Organization

Both `apps/web/` and `apps/api/` use a **feature-based** organization pattern inside their `features/` directories. Each feature is a self-contained module:

```
features/
├── wallet/                  # Wallet feature
│   ├── WalletDisplay.tsx   # (client) UI component
│   ├── walletSlice.ts      # (client) State management
│   ├── walletRoutes.ts     # (server) API routes
│   ├── walletService.ts    # (server) Business logic
│   └── walletTypes.ts      # Shared types
│
├── leaderboard/            # Leaderboard feature
│   ├── Leaderboard.tsx
│   ├── leaderboardRoutes.ts
│   └── ...
│
└── [feature-name]/         # Pattern repeats
```

**Benefits**:

- **Colocation** - Related code lives together
- **Discoverability** - Easy to find all code for a feature
- **Modularity** - Features can be developed/tested in isolation
- **Scalability** - Add new features without touching existing code

## 📋 Core Document Types

### 1. Production Roadmap ([[PRODUCTION_ROADMAP]])

**Purpose**: The master document that provides a bird's-eye view of the entire journey from POC to production. This is the first document stakeholders read.

**Key Sections Explained**:

#### Current State Assessment

Be brutally honest about where you are. This creates urgency and justifies the work.

```markdown
## Current State Assessment

### ✅ What We Have (POC Level)

- 6 working games (Slots, Wheel, Pigman, Blackjack, High/Low, Roulette)
- Basic wallet system (balance, transactions)
- WebSocket and REST APIs
- Interactive API documentation

### ⚠️ What's Missing for Production

- Authentication & authorization
- Rate limiting & abuse prevention
- Error handling & monitoring
- Security hardening
- Multi-tenancy support
```

#### Phase Breakdown

Each phase gets a summary with **specific deliverables** (not vague goals):

````markdown
## Phase 2: Authentication & Authorization

**Goal:** Implement flexible authentication supporting multiple providers
**Duration:** 3-4 weeks

### 2.1 Authentication Architecture

[Include ASCII diagrams showing the flow]

### 2.2 Implementation Tasks

- [ ] JWT validation middleware (support multiple issuers)
- [ ] Claims-based authorization middleware
- [ ] Role definition system (player, admin, operator, super-admin)
- [ ] Tenant isolation middleware

### 2.3 Authorization Roles & Permissions

```typescript
enum Role {
  PLAYER = "player", // Play games, view own data
  MODERATOR = "moderator", // Ban users, view reports
  OPERATOR = "operator", // Configure games, view analytics
  ADMIN = "admin", // Full access to tenant
}
```
````

````

#### Implementation Priority Matrix
The roadmap must clearly communicate **dependencies** and **blocking items**:

```markdown
## Implementation Priority Matrix

|-------|----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Phase 1: API Endpoints | 🔴 HIGH | Yes | Medium | 2-3 weeks |
| Phase 2: Auth | 🔴 HIGH | Yes | High | 3-4 weeks |
| Phase 3: Security | 🔴 HIGH | Yes | Medium | 2 weeks |
| Phase 4: Monitoring | 🟡 MEDIUM | No | Medium | 2 weeks |
| Phase 5: Performance | 🟡 MEDIUM | No | High | 2-3 weeks |
````

#### Quick Wins Section

Identify things that can be done **immediately** to show progress:

```markdown
## Quick Wins (Can Start Immediately)

1. **Enhanced Wallet Endpoints** (1 week)
   - Transaction history with filtering
   - Wallet summary endpoints
2. **Input Validation** (3 days)
   - Add Zod schemas to all endpoints
3. **Error Handling** (3 days)
   - Standardize error responses

# Architectural Decision Records

## 📋 Decision Log

| ID      | Decision                  | Status      | Date       |
| ------- | ------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| ADR-001 | Use Hono over Express     | ✅ Accepted | 2026-01-12 |
| ADR-002 | PostgreSQL for primary DB | ✅ Accepted | 2026-01-13 |

---

## ADR-001: Use Hono over Express

**Status**: ✅ Accepted  
**Date**: 2026-01-12  
**Deciders**: Engineering team

### Context

Need to choose a web framework for the API server.

### Decision

Use **Hono** for its TypeScript-first design and OpenAPI integration.

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Type-safe routing out of the box
- Built-in OpenAPI generation
- Lightweight (~14kb)

**Negative:**

- Smaller ecosystem than Express
- Team needs to learn new patterns

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Why Not                                |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Express     | Legacy patterns, no native TypeScript  |
| Fastify     | More complex, less OpenAPI integration |
```

**When to Write an ADR**:

- Choosing between technologies
- Defining architectural patterns
- Security or compliance decisions
- Any decision a new team member would question

**Key Rule**: ADRs are immutable. If a decision changes, mark old as "Superseded" and create new ADR.

### 9. Phase Tasks (`phases/phaseN/PHASEN_TASKS.md`)

**Purpose**: The most detailed document. This is where AI and developers spend most of their time. Each task must be specific enough that someone unfamiliar with the codebase can execute it.

**Key Sections Explained**:

#### Header with Real-Time Status
Always include current progress prominently at the top:

```markdown
# Phase 2: Authentication & Authorization - Implementation Plan

**Duration:** 3-4 weeks
**Status:** 🚧 IN PROGRESS (Sprint 3 - Task 8 complete)
**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH - Blocking for production
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-24

### 📈 Current Progress
- ✅ Sprint 1 (Auth Foundation): 100% complete (4/4 tasks)
- ✅ Sprint 2 (Authorization & RBAC): 100% complete (3/3 tasks)
- 🚧 Sprint 3 (Multi-Tenancy): 75% complete (3/4 tasks done)

**Components Implemented:** 9.75 / 10 (97.5%)
**Lines Added:** +3,450 / ~3,500
**Branch:** `feature/phase2-auth-multitenant`
````

#### 🔍 Audit Summary with Risk Assessment

**This is critical.** Before writing tasks, you must audit the current state and identify risks:

```markdown
## 🔍 Authentication Audit Summary

**CRITICAL FINDINGS**: Currently **NO authentication or authorization** exists.

### 📊 Security Gaps Identified:

- **No Authentication**: All API endpoints are publicly accessible
- **No Authorization**: No role-based access control (RBAC)
- **No Tenant Isolation**: Single-tenant architecture
- **Direct playerId Access**: Any client can impersonate any player
- **Admin Endpoints Exposed**: `/api/wallet/freeze` has no protection

### ⚠️ Impact Assessment:

- **Critical Security Risk**: Anyone can access/modify any player's data
- **No Production Readiness**: Cannot deploy without authentication
- **Compliance Risk**: GDPR/privacy violations without access controls
- **Business Risk**: Cannot support multiple tenants/customers
- **Fraud Risk**: No protection against player impersonation

### 📈 Scale of Work:

- **10 Major Tasks** (Tasks 1-10) → ✅ **7 COMPLETE**, **3 REMAINING**
- **45+ Sub-Steps** → ✅ **38 COMPLETED**, **7+ REMAINING**
- **3-4 Weeks** estimated → **~1 Week REMAINING**
```

#### 🎯 Target Architecture

Include **diagrams** (ASCII is fine) showing the end state:

```markdown

#### 🚧 Task 8: Multi-Tenancy Implementation

**Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Complexity**: 🔴 HARD  
**Package**: `server/src/`  
**Dependencies**: Tasks 1-6
**Status**: 🚧 IN PROGRESS (Sessions 1-3 Complete)

**Implementation Strategy**: Phased approach with 4 sessions:

- ✅ **Session 1**: Schema & Foundation (Complete)
- ✅ **Session 2**: Query Updates (Complete)
- ✅ **Session 3**: Advanced Features (Complete)
- ⏳ **Session 4**: Testing & Polish (Remaining)

**Sub-Steps**:

- [x] 8.1: Create tenants table
- [x] 8.2: Add `tenant_id` to all existing tables
- [x] 8.3: Create database migration for tenant columns
- [x] 8.4: Create tenant isolation helpers
- [x] 8.5: Update all Drizzle queries to include `tenant_id` filter
- [x] 8.6: Add tenant context to WebSocket connections
- [x] 8.7: Implement tenant management API
- [ ] 8.8: Write multi-tenancy tests (Session 4)
- [ ] 8.9: Performance test with multiple tenants (Session 4)

**Known Issues**:

1. **Scalar Lock Icon Missing**: Only 7 of 29 endpoints have `security`
   - Fix: Add global security to OpenAPI root
2. **WebSocket Tenant Context**: Currently using hardcoded 'default'
   - Fix: Extract tenantId from JWT in WebSocket auth

**Session 3 Deliverables**:

- ✅ `server/src/api/tenants.ts` - Tenant management API (223 lines)
- ✅ `docs/TENANT_SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md` (152 lines)
- ✅ Updated 29 API endpoints with tenant filtering

## ⚠️ Risk Identification & Mitigation

**Risk management is embedded throughout the task documents.** Here's how:

### Risk Categories to Track

```markdown
### ⚠️ Risk Assessment

| Risk                             | Impact      | Likelihood | Mitigation                                          |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Database performance degradation | 🔴 High     | 🟡 Medium  | Add indexes on tenant_id, test with large datasets  |
| Breaking changes to API          | 🔴 High     | 🟢 Low     | Version API, comprehensive testing, backward compat |
| Scope creep                      | 🟡 Medium   | 🔴 High    | Stick to defined endpoints, defer nice-to-haves     |
| Testing time underestimated      | 🟡 Medium   | 🟡 Medium  | Write tests in parallel with implementation         |
| Security bypass vulnerability    | 🔴 Critical | 🟢 Low     | Penetration testing, security review                |
```

### Risk Indicators in Task Status

Use status indicators to flag risky tasks:

```markdown
#### Task 4: WebSocket Authentication

**Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Complexity**: 🔴 HARD ← Red = high risk
**Risk Flag**: ⚠️ Integration complexity with existing game handlers
```

### Known Issues Section

Every task in progress should document discovered issues:

```markdown
**Known Issues**:

1. **Token Refresh Race Condition** ⚠️
   - Problem: Concurrent requests during refresh cause 401s
   - Workaround: Queue requests during refresh
   - Fix ETA: Task 9
2. **Memory Leak in Auth Cache** 🟡
   - Problem: JWKS cache not invalidating properly
   - Impact: ~2MB/hour growth
   - Fix: Add TTL cleanup in Task 10
```

### Security Considerations Section

For security-critical phases, include explicit guidance:

```markdown
### Security Considerations

- **Never log tokens** in plain text
- **Use secure random** for API key generation
- **Hash API keys** before storage (bcrypt or argon2)
- **Rotate JWKS keys** periodically
- **Set proper CORS** per tenant
- **Use HTTPS** in production (enforce)
- **Implement token refresh** coordination
```

### Migration & Compatibility Notes

Document how changes affect existing functionality:

```markdown
### Compatibility Notes

- Maintain REST API contract (no breaking changes)
- WebSocket protocol unchanged (auth in connection, not messages)
- Game logic unchanged (replace hardcoded playerId with auth user)
- Frontend changes minimal (add Authorization header, handle 401)

### Migration Strategy

- **Phase 2.1** (Week 1): Add auth middleware as optional
- **Phase 2.2** (Week 2-3): Enable on new endpoints first
- **Phase 2.3** (Week 4): Full enforcement, remove optional mode
```

## 🚀 Getting Started Checklist

When bootstrapping a new project:

### 1. Create Monorepo Structure

```bash
# Create package structure
mkdir -p apps/web/src/{components,features,pages,api}
mkdir -p apps/api/src/{routes,features,middleware,services,auth,config,utils}
mkdir -p packages/shared/src
mkdir -p docs/phases/phase{1,2,3,4,5}/

# Initialize workspaces
npm init -y
# Edit package.json to add workspaces or pnpm-workspace.yaml
```

### 2. Create Core Documents

- [ ] [[README]] - Project overview, quick start
- [ ] [[CURRENT_FOCUS]] - Quick reference for active work (AI session handoffs)
- [ ] [[README]] - Documentation index
- [ ] [[TECH_STACK]] - Technology choices & versions
- [ ] [[ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE]] - Why decisions were made, patterns
- [ ] [[DECISIONS]] - Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
- [ ] [[DESIGN_SYSTEM]] - Colors, typography, components
- [ ] [[PRODUCTION_ROADMAP]] - High-level roadmap
- [ ] `docs/phases/README.md` - Phase overview

### 3. Define Your Phases

Identify 4-8 major phases based on:

- **Foundation** - Core infrastructure, basic features
- **Security** - Auth, validation, hardening
