## 🔄 Rollback & Contingency Plans

> _For phases with significant risk, document how to safely undo changes._

### High-Risk Tasks Identified

| Task     | Risk Level | Rollback Complexity | Backup Required      |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Task X.X | 🔴 High    | Medium              | ✅ Yes - DB snapshot |
| Task Y.Y | 🟡 Medium  | Low                 | ❌ No - code only    |

### Pre-Phase Checklist

- [ ] Database backup created: `[backup location/timestamp]`
- [ ] Current branch tagged: `git tag pre-phase-N-backup`
- [ ] Dependent services notified of potential rollback window
- [ ] Rollback runbook reviewed by team

### Emergency Rollback Procedure

**If critical failure occurs:**

1. **Stop** - Don't make additional changes
2. **Assess** - Identify what broke and impact scope
3. **Communicate** - Notify stakeholders: [contact list]
4. **Rollback** - Execute steps below:

```bash
# Code rollback
git revert --no-commit HEAD~N  # N = number of commits to undo
git commit -m "Rollback: [reason]"

# Database rollback (if applicable)
# [Database-specific restore commands]
```

5. **Verify** - Run smoke tests to confirm system stability
6. **Document** - Add post-mortem notes to this section

### Post-Mortem Notes

_Add notes here if rollback was executed:_

- **Date**:
- **Trigger**:
- **Resolution**:
- **Prevention**:
